# RECONNAISSANCE-DES-EMOTIONS/EMOTION-RECOGNITION
  Emotion recognition using AI is a technology that involves using machine learning algorithms to analyze and identify human emotions from various sources such as facial expressions, voice tone, and body language.

  This project will present two methods for emotion detection using both Deep Learning and Machine Learning

## First Project: Real time Emotion detection Using DeepFace:

    DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition algorithm developed by Facebook's AI research team.
In this project we will do a Real-time emotion detection using DeepFace to detect emotions in live video streams or video frames in real-time.
